/**
 * A callback function that will be called when a file or directory with
 * a file monitor have reported a change, i.e. a file or directory has
 * been added or removed.
 *
 * @deleted@ is TRUE if a file or directory has been deleted. If it was
 * created, it will be FALSE.
 * @path@ is the path to the file or directory that was affected. The
 * memory will be freed after the call to callback.
 * @changed_node@ is the subtree that was affected. If the file or
 * directory was created, then it has been added to @root@ already. If
 * it was deleted, @changed_node@ has been removed from @root@ and it
 * along with its subnodes have been freed. The pointer may thus point
 * to an invalid structure.
 * @root@ is the root node of the tree that @changed_node@ is/was part
 * of.
 * @data@ is user provided data that will be sent back to the callback
 * function unaltered.
