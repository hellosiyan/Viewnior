# Viewnior - Fast and elegant image viewer

This is Viewnior, an image viewer program. Created to be simple, fast and elegant. Its minimalistic interface provides more screenspace for your images. Among its features are:

  * Fullscreen & Slideshow
  * Rotate, flip, crop, save, delete images
  * Animation support
  * Browse only selected images
  * Navigation window
  * Set image as wallpaper (Gnome 2, Gnome 3, XFCE, MATE, Cinnamon, LXDE, FluxBox, Nitrogen, Puppylinux)
  * EXIF and IPTC metadata
  * Simple interface
  * Configurable mouse actions
  * Recursively opens images in subfolders
  * Updates when images are added or removed from folder

Most of the Viewnior's sources handling image viewing are adopted from the GtkImageView library by Bj√∂rn Lindqvist. The files were cleaned up and modified, so that unused functionality were removed (GtkImageToolSelector, GtkImageToolPainter, GtkZooms). Prefixes were changed from gtk_ to uni_ for clarity.
